This is a very small plugin, designed to simply re-write the default user signup email that gets sent out to the users.

!!! if you want to change the email text, the email template is "/email-template.php".  open that file and edit to your heart's content.

The code of the user-emails.php file shouldn't need to be altered much, unless file names have been changed.  It sends an email to the admin and to the new user.
